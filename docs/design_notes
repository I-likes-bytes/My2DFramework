### Design Notes

## 2025/11/1

I'm going to create classes for different types of Objects. I was trying to just
create a Class for a Sign Object that I wanted to put in the game that would 
prevent the player from walking over it and realized I would be better suited
already creating classes for different classifications of objects.
Eventually I want there to be a combat system and some sort of level system that
will enable either abilities or different weapons off. Off the top of my head 
some classes that I can create now are

-StaticSolidObjects
These wont move at all and will simply just obstruct the player's path, I guess
this could also eventually be used if I wanted to add buildings of some sort in
that case this class could also be used again

-InteractiveObjects
These don't move but can be interacted. I was thinking in this particular case
for my own game I could use the class for XP, Weapons, Potions, Chests, etc. 
This class will be reused a lot I'm already assuming. 

More classifications for objects will be thought of as I get further into the 
game, the only reason this is a thing now is because I bought an asset pack and
wanted to start utilizing some of these for different objects I had in mind.
