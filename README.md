    This project is to serve as a framework for developement of top-down 2D
games in Java. Ultimately the goal of this project is to create a game that is 
functional and somewhat entertaining. My secondary goal is to create a cleanly
documented codebase that can easily be extended or altered by myself or others
for other game projects.
